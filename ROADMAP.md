## 📊 Feature Tiers

### Tier 1: High-Impact Features (Recommended Next)
These features have the highest user impact and are feasible with existing architecture.

#### 🏆 Net Worth Tracker & Historical Snapshots
**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Status**: IMPLEMENTED (May 30, 2026)

**Description**:
Users need to see the big picture: total wealth growth, not just debt reduction. Monthly snapshots of net worth (total assets - total liabilities) create a powerful motivational tool and help users understand their complete financial trajectory.

**Delivered Features**:
- Monthly net worth snapshot with month-level upsert (auto-captured and manual capture)
- Historical trend chart with 3/6/12 month controls
- Net worth vs. liabilities trend visualization
- Asset growth vs. debt reduction composition chart
- Snapshot history audit table (date, assets, liabilities, net worth, income, debt paid)
- Milestone celebrations at +$5K net worth increments from first snapshot
- Accounts dashboard widget showing current net worth and change from prior snapshot

**Why This Matters**:
- Complements debt-focused view with holistic perspective
- Motivates users with visible wealth accumulation
- Shows impact of income + savings + debt payoff together
- Integrates naturally with existing account + debt data

**Technical Approach**:
```javascript
// Add to app state
this.monthlySnapshots = [
  {
    date: '2026-05-29',
    totalAssets: 15000,      // sum of positive account balances
    totalLiabilities: 8500,  // sum of all debts
    netWorth: 6500,
    debtPaymentMade: 1200,
    incomeReceived: 4500
  }
];
```

**Implementation Notes**:
- Data persisted via localStorage, JSON export/import, and sanitization pipeline
- Reports tab now includes a dedicated Net Worth panel
- Manual snapshot capture is available directly from Reports
- Snapshot metrics include `totalAssets`, `totalLiabilities`, `netWorth`, `debtPaymentMade`, and `incomeReceived`

**Follow-up Enhancements**:
- Optional snapshot history table export
- Configurable milestone thresholds

#### 📈 Financial Health Dashboard
**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: LOW-MEDIUM | **Status**: IMPLEMENTED (June 8, 2026)

**Description**:
A single-page overview of key financial metrics using industry-standard indicators. Reuses existing calculations and presents them as gauges, progress bars, and summary cards.

**Delivered Features**:
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio** — Chart.js doughnut gauge; Healthy (<28%) / Moderate (<40%) / High Risk (≥40%) badge
- **Savings Rate** — Emergency + sinking fund contributions as % of income; Strong / Moderate / Low badge
- **Emergency Fund Coverage** — Per-fund months of coverage with progress bar; empty-state when no funds
- **Debt Payoff Timeline** — Years to debt-free at minimum payments (avalanche); "Debt Free!" state when no debts; payoff date and % progress bar
- **Monthly Cash Flow** — Income minus all outflows; Surplus / Break Even / Deficit badge with itemized breakdown
- **Budget Allocation** — Bill + expense categories as % of income with color-coded progress bars; debt payments row included
- Internal navigation links route to Savings, Liabilities, or Plan page from each card
- Dark-mode-aware gauge background color

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implemented in `src/health.js` as `renderHealthDashboard(app)`
- All user-sourced strings rendered via `escapeHtml()` (XSS safe)
- Chart instances stored on `app._healthDtiChart` and `app._healthSavingsChart`; destroyed on re-render to prevent memory leaks
- Gauge values clamped to [0, 100] regardless of raw ratio

**Test Coverage**:
- 18 feature tests in `tests/features/test_health.py` covering all six cards, nav links, empty states, and error-free rendering
- 2 XSS tests in `tests/security/test_xss.py` (bill category names, emergency fund account names)
- 2 validation tests in `tests/security/test_input_validation.py` (gauge clamping above 100%)
- Health dashboard step added to `tests/integration/test_smoke.py`

---

#### 🛑 Budget Alerts & Overspend Warnings
**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: LOW | **Status**: PROPOSED

**Description**:
Real-time spending alerts help users stay within budget. Warn at 80%, 100%, and 110% of category limits with visual indicators and optional badge notifications.

**Features**:
- Alert when spending exceeds budget threshold (80%, 100%, 110%)
- Month-to-date spending by category summary
- Projected month-end total based on current pace
- Highlight overspent categories in red
- Header badge showing count of overspent categories

**Example Display**:
```
⚠️ Groceries: $245 / $200 (122%) — Over budget!
✓ Dining Out: $87 / $150 (58%)
⚠️ Entertainment: $165 / $100 (165%) — SIGNIFICANTLY OVER
```

**Technical Approach**:
- Compare cumulative expenses vs. budget each month
- Calculate daily burn rate and project month-end total
- Store alert preferences (80/100/110% thresholds)

---

### Tier 2: Medium-Impact Features
Valuable additions that enhance core functionality.

#### 🎯 Savings Goals with Progress Tracking
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Status**: PROPOSED

**Description**:
Balance debt payoff focus with asset building. Users can define savings goals (target amount + deadline) and track progress with visual indicators.

**Features**:
- Define goal: "Save $5,000 by Dec 2026" or "Build 6-month emergency fund"
- Automatic progress calculation from savings/sinking funds
- Month-by-month breakdown to meet goal
- Progress bars with percentage complete
- Milestone notifications
- Link to emergency/sinking funds for contribution planning

**Example**:
```
Goal: Build 3-month Emergency Fund
Target: $9,000 by December 2026
Current: $2,500 (28%)
Required Monthly: $650
On track: ✓ Yes
```

---

#### 📊 Spending Analysis by Category
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Status**: ✅ DELIVERED June 16, 2026

**Description**:
Visual breakdown of where money is going. Pie charts, trend analysis, and category rankings help users understand spending patterns and identify areas to optimize.

**Features**:
- Pie chart: spending by category (interactive, expandable)
- Bar chart: category trends (month-over-month comparison)
- Ranked list: highest spending categories
- Category drill-down: see individual transactions
- Month comparison: "Groceries up 15% vs. last month"
- Annual summary by category

**Why This Matters**:
- Identifies spending patterns and anomalies
- Helps users find areas to cut
- Motivates with visible progress in categories
- Leverages existing bill/expense categorization

---

#### 🔄 Multiple Scenario Comparison
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Status**: PROPOSED

**Description**:
"What if?" analysis for debt payoff planning. Users save different payment scenarios and compare outcomes side-by-side.

**Features**:
- Save current plan as "Scenario 1"
- Create variations: "Plan A: Pay extra $200/month" vs. "Plan B: Aggressive approach"
- Compare metrics: payoff date, total interest, total paid
- Show interest saved between scenarios
- Restore any saved scenario to make it current

**Example**:
```
Scenario Comparison:
                    Baseline    +$200/mo    Aggressive
Payoff Date:        May 2029    Dec 2028    Oct 2027
Total Interest:     $4,200      $3,100      $1,800
Total Paid:         $24,200     $23,100     $21,800
Interest Saved:     —           $1,100      $2,400
```

#### 🔮 Cash Flow Forecasting
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: MEDIUM-HIGH | **Status**: IMPLEMENTED (June 10, 2026)

**Description**:
Project account balances forward 1/2/3/6/12 months based on current income, expenses, and debt payments. Identify periods of cash shortage or surplus — including mid-month dips that month-end balances alone don't reveal.

**Delivered Features**:
- Reports › 🔮 Forecast tab with a selectable horizon (1/2/3/6/12 months)
- Account selector — "Total Cash Position" (sum of all asset-type accounts) or any individual checking/savings/cash/investment account
- Summary stats: Current Balance, Lowest Projected, Highest Projected
- Line chart highlighting the lowest (red) and highest (green) projected month-end balances, with the trend line turning red for any negative balance
- Notable-month detection — months whose total outflow exceeds a configurable threshold (default 130%, range 100-500%) of the average monthly outflow are flagged with their top 3 outflow drivers
- Negative-balance warning banner when any projected month-end balance goes negative
- **Intra-month running-low tracking** — walks each month's transactions in chronological order to find the lowest point the balance actually reaches (e.g. rent due before a paycheck arrives), even when the month ends positive:
  - Warning banner for months that dip negative intra-month but recover by month-end, showing the dip date/amount and the recovery balance
  - "Lowest Projected" stat reflects the true intra-month low (with its date) rather than just the lowest month-end balance
  - Table rows flag "Dips to $X on \<date\> before recovering" for any month where the intra-month low is below the month-end balance
- Horizon, account selection, and notable-month threshold are persisted to localStorage and round-trip through JSON export/import

**Why This Matters**:
- Month-end balances can hide dangerous mid-month cash crunches (e.g. rent due on the 1st, paycheck not until the 15th)
- Helps users plan around irregular or seasonal expenses before they cause an overdraft
- Builds entirely on the existing ledger running-balance and account-projection infrastructure — no new data model

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implemented in `src/forecast.js` as `renderCashFlowForecast(app)`; `getAccountForecastSeries(app, accountId, monthsAhead)` in `src/ledger.js` provides the per-account month-by-month projection plus the intra-month low balance/date
- "Total Cash Position" excludes liability-type accounts (`Credit Card`, `Loan`) via `getForecastAssetAccounts(app)`. Combining accounts re-merges every account's transactions chronologically per month to compute the combined intra-month low, since per-account lows can occur on different days and can't simply be summed
- Floating-point comparisons use a `1e-9` epsilon to avoid false positives from rounding

**Test Coverage**:
- 13 feature tests in `tests/features/test_forecast.py` covering horizon/account selection, notable months and drivers, negative-balance warnings, and intra-month dip detection (per-account, combined "Total Cash Position", and no-dip cases)
- XSS and end-to-end smoke test coverage for the Forecast tab

---

#### 💰 Break-Even Analysis per Debt
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: LOW | **Status**: PROPOSED

**Description**:
For each debt, show the payoff math clearly: minimum payment only vs. planned payment. Users see exactly how much faster they'll pay off debt with their plan.

**Features**:
- Per-debt payoff date display
- Days/months/years to payoff at current plan
- Interest savings vs. minimum payment only
- Timeline visualization
- One-click "accelerate this debt" option

**Example Card**:
```
Visa (Credit Card)
Current Balance: $2,400
APR: 18.5%
Your Plan: $450/month
Payoff Date: Dec 2026 (7 months)
Total Interest: $285

Vs. Minimum Only: May 2028 (19 months, $1,200 interest)
You're saving $915 in interest! 🎉
```

---

### Tier 3: Enhancement Features
Polish and quality-of-life improvements.

#### 📋 Advanced Ledger Features
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Status**: PROPOSED

**Features**:
- Recurring templates auto-apply (create once, auto-generate)
- Transaction search/filter by name, date, amount
- Flag important transactions (refunds, large expenses)
- Custom categorization per transaction
- Recurring item history and suppression
- Bulk operations (mark multiple as paid)

---

#### 📅 Bill Payment Tracker
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: LOW | **Status**: PROPOSED (partially seeded)

**Note**: The standalone "Bills" feature this item was originally written
against (`#billForm`/`#billList`) was removed from the UI on May 29, 2026 in
favor of Recurring Templates (`src/recurring.js`). The "mark as paid" piece of
this item has been delivered for Recurring Templates via Quick Win #4
(`paidMonths`). The remaining items below stay PROPOSED, but would need to be
redefined against Recurring Templates rather than the old Bills model if
pursued.

**Features**:
- [x] Mark items as "due" vs. "paid" — delivered for Recurring Templates (Quick Win #4)
- [ ] Track payment history and dates
- [ ] Late payment warnings (occurrence date passed without being marked paid)
- [ ] Confirmation dates when payment sent
- [ ] Monthly payment checklist

---

#### 💡 Income Growth Projections
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Status**: PROPOSED

**Features**:
- Model salary increases (annual % or fixed amount)
- See impact on debt payoff timeline
- Plan for bonuses/commissions
- "What if I get a 5% raise?" scenarios

---

#### 🔧 Account Reconciliation Tool
**Priority**: LOW-MEDIUM | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Status**: IMPLEMENTED (June 13, 2026)

**Delivered Features**:
- New 🔄 Reconcile page with a card per account showing the current tracked balance, an editable statement date (defaults to today) and statement balance, and a live, color-coded difference as the statement balance is edited
- "Expected transactions since {date}" details per account, listing bills/recurring items due since the last reconciliation (or the start of the month if none yet)
- Reconciling updates the account's tracked balance and records a history entry (previous → statement balance, difference, date, note)
- History table with an account filter and per-entry delete (does not revert the balance)
- 🔄 Reconcile this account button on the Ledger page (when a single account is selected) opens a quick-reconcile modal with the same fields, plus Escape/Enter keyboard handling
- `app.reconciliations` round-trips through localStorage and JSON export/import, with sanitization rejecting entries with a missing `accountId` or non-finite `statementBalance`
- Orphaned history entries (account later deleted) render with an "Unknown account" label instead of crashing

**Why This Matters**:
- Lets users correct drift between the tracked balance and their bank's actual balance after fees, interest, or missed transactions
- Surfaces upcoming/expected transactions so users can spot what's likely causing a discrepancy before adjusting the balance

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implemented in `src/reconciliation.js`: `renderReconciliationPage`, `applyReconciliation`, `reconcileAccount`, `deleteReconciliationEntry`, `getExpectedTransactionsInRange`, `openReconcileModal`
- `getExpectedTransactionsInRange` reuses `getLedgerTransactionsForMonth` from `src/ledger.js`, walking month-by-month across the requested date range
- `todayISO()` added to `src/utils.js`; `sanitizeReconciliation` added to `src/storage.js` following the existing sanitize/round-trip conventions

**Test Coverage**:
- 11 feature tests in `tests/features/test_reconciliation.py` covering `applyReconciliation`, history entries, expected-transactions lookups, sanitization, and import/export/clear round-trips
- 8 UI tests in `tests/ui/test_reconciliation_actions.py` covering the empty state, live diff, history filter/delete, expected-transactions details, and the Ledger quick-reconcile modal
- XSS, input-validation, and accessibility coverage added to `tests/security/test_xss.py`, `tests/security/test_input_validation.py`, and `tests/ui/test_accessibility.py`

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap by Release

### v3.1 (Released - June 8, 2026)
**Focus**: Financial Visibility & Motivation

- [x] Financial Health Dashboard (HIGH impact, LOW-MEDIUM effort)
- [ ] Budget Alerts & Warnings (HIGH impact, LOW effort)
- [x] Net Worth Tracker (HIGH impact, MEDIUM effort)

**Shipped with v3.1**:
- Financial Health Dashboard (`src/health.js`) with all six metric cards
- Multi-account ledger: items without account links route to a sentinel bucket and appear in report-wide aggregations but are excluded from the per-account ledger view
- Import/export: `recurringTemplates`, `emergencyFunds`, and `sinkingFunds` now fully round-trip through backup JSON
- Import: account IDs are now preserved on import so all `accountId` cross-references in income, debt, bills, and recurring items remain valid after a restore
- Reports tab: aggregations now include items not linked to any account (previously only linked items were counted)
- Test suite expanded: 22 new tests covering the Health Dashboard (feature, security, integration)

**Shipped post-v3.1 (June 10, 2026)**:
- Cash Flow Forecasting (`src/forecast.js`), originally planned for v3.3, shipped early — see Tier 2 entry above for details
- Test suite expanded: 13 new tests covering the Forecast tab (`tests/features/test_forecast.py`)

**Shipped post-v3.1 (June 13, 2026)**:
- Account Reconciliation Tool (`src/reconciliation.js`), originally planned for v3.4+, shipped early — see Tier 3 entry above for details
- Test suite expanded: 26 new tests covering reconciliation (feature, UI, security, accessibility)

**Shipped post-v3.1 (June 15-16, 2026)**:
- Spending Analysis by Category (`src/spending.js`), originally planned for v3.2, shipped early — see Tier 2 entry for details
- Main nav redesigned into three labeled groups (Overview/Manage/Analyze) with active-group highlighting, `aria-current`, and keyboard reachability
- Reports nav redesigned with a sticky, grouped tab bar
- Test suite expanded: tests covering spending analysis, grouped main nav, and grouped reports nav

**Shipped post-v3.1 (June 16-17, 2026)**:
- Fixed two CSP violations surfaced after the nav redesign: `connect-src` now allows `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` (Chart.js sourcemap fetch) in both `index.html`'s meta tag and `nginx.conf`'s header; `guide.html`'s inline `<script>` and `<style>` blocks were externalized to `src/guideTheme.js` and `guide.css` so they aren't blocked by nginx's CSP header in production
- Added a static test that asserts `index.html`'s CSP meta tag and `nginx.conf`'s CSP header stay in sync, to catch this class of bug going forward
- Mobile button-height and main-nav label text-content test fixes
- Test suite expanded to 264 tests (up from 140); added coverage for the dormant Bills data model/calculations (`tests/features/test_bills.py`) and CSV schedule export (`tests/integration/test_workflows.py`)

---

## 📋 Quick Wins (Low Effort, Noticeable Impact)

These can be implemented quickly and add immediate value:

1. ~~**Debt Payoff Timeline Display** (30 min)~~ ✅ **Delivered June 14, 2026** — each debt card shows a "📅 Payoff Date" row sourced from `app._debtSummaryRows` (populated when the user clicks "Calculate Payment Plan" on the Plan page)

2. ⏭️ **Month-to-Date Spending Summary** — **Deferred**, folded into Tier 1 "🛑 Budget Alerts & Overspend Warnings" (requires a per-category monthly budget limit concept that doesn't exist yet)

3. ~~**Dashboard Page** (2-3 hours)~~ ✅ **Delivered in v3.1** — Financial Health Dashboard (`src/health.js`)

4. ~~**Bill Payment Status** (1 hour)~~ ✅ **Delivered June 14, 2026** — retargeted to Recurring Templates: a "Mark as paid this month" toggle (`paidMonths` per template, mirrors `skippedMonths`). The standalone Bills feature this item originally targeted was removed in favor of Recurring Templates (May 29, 2026).

5. ⏭️ **Budget Overspend Badges** — **Deferred**, folded into Tier 1 "🛑 Budget Alerts & Overspend Warnings" (same underlying budget-limit concept as #2)

---

## 🏗️ Technical Considerations

### Data Structure Additions

```javascript
// New app state properties
this.monthlySnapshots = [];      // Net worth history
this.savingsGoals = [];           // User-defined goals
this.scenarios = [];              // Saved payment scenarios
this.budgetAlerts = {};           // Alert preferences
this.reconciliationEntries = [];  // Account adjustments
```

### Storage Impact
- Current localStorage usage: ~50-200KB typical
- Monthly snapshots: ~100 bytes each (12 months/year = 1.2KB/year)
- No breaking changes needed

### UI/UX Changes
- New "Dashboard" page in navigation
- "Goals" tab
- "Scenarios" comparison modal
- Notification badge in header
- Enhanced Reports page

### Performance
- All calculations client-side (no server needed)
- Monthly aggregations can be lazy-loaded
- Charts use existing Chart.js infrastructure

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Dashboard page views per session
- Time spent comparing scenarios
- Goal progress check-ins per month
- Budget alert interactions

### Business Impact
- User retention (sessions per week)
- Feature usage (% of users using new features)
- Motivation indicators (goal achievements)
- Export/backup frequency

---

## 📝 Notes for Contributors

### Before Starting Implementation

4. Maintain mobile responsiveness (test at 480px, 768px, 1024px)

### Architecture Principles
- Keep client-side only (no server)
- Maintain modular structure (one feature per file if possible)
- All user input must be sanitized
- Use `escapeHtml()` for all output
- No external dependencies beyond Chart.js

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for calculations
- Integration tests for UI changes
- Security tests for any input handling
